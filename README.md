# geneticalgorithm

Genetic Algorithm library.

To run an optimization, it is necessary to create a config GA dictionary 

```ga_config = {
            "max_num_iteration": 5,
            "population_size": 100,
            "mutation_probability": 0.01,
            "elit_ratio": 2,
            "crossover_probability": 0.8,
            "parents_portion": 0.2,
            "crossover_type": "uniform",
            "max_iteration_without_improv": 20,
            "multiple_cpu": False,
        }
```
