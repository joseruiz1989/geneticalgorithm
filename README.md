# geneticalgorithm

Genetic Algorithm library.

To run a Genetic Algorithm optimization is necessary to clone the python repository https://github.com/joseruiz1989/geneticalgorithm

Into a new python file we need to import the library

```
from GeneticAlgorithm import GeneticAlgorithm as GA
from GeneticAlgorithm import *
```

The next step is create a config GA dictionary

```
ga_config = {
    "max_num_iteration": 5,
    "population_size": 100,
    "mutation_probability": 0.01,
    "elit_ratio": 2,
    "crossover_probability": 0.8,
    "parents_portion": 0.2,
    "crossover_type": "uniform",
    "max_iteration_without_improv": 20,
    "multiple_cpu": False,
}
```

The parameters are:

- "max_num_iteration": int -> number of iterations ou generations
- "population_size": int -> number of individuals in each generation
- "mutation_probability": float between 0 and 1, where 0 is 0% and 1 is 100%
  - values below 0 and above 1 will be replaced to 0 and 1 respectively
  - probability of each bit in each individual to be replaced 

- "elit_ratio": float or int -> number of individual to keep in the next generation
  - values below 0 will be replaced to 0, this means that no individual will be kept for the next generation
  - values between 0+ and 1 will be replaced to 1, this means that only one individual will be kept for the next generation
  - values above 1 will be rounded and that amount of individuals will be kept for the next generation
    - if this value is higer than the population, will be kept only the population size individuals
- "parents_portion": 0.3, -> the portion of new generation filled by the members of the previous generation, chosen by the ga sorted method
- "crossover_probability": 1.0, -> float between 0 and 1, where 0 is 0% and 1 is 100%
  - values below 0 and above 1 will be replaced to 0 and 1 respectively
  - percent of new population to be filled by sons 

> ex: population:100
> elit_ratio = 2
> parents_portion = 0.1
> crossover_probability = 0.9
> then the new generation will be
> 2 - best individuals of las generation, total 2
> 8 - selected individuals of the last generation, total 10 
> 80 - new individuals generated by crossing the selected parents, total 90
> 10 - random individuals, total 100

- "multiple_cpu": False,: bool -> if the simulations are performed in only one core or in multiples cores (total in the machine)
